# counter_app

The first Flutter project.

## What I learned

1. Make simple functions to increase and decrease the counter value.
2. Change the styles of ElevatedButton() like colour, size, and border.
3. Use the Row() function to put the two buttons next to each other.
4. Use SizedBox(width: value) and SizedBox(height: value) to adjust the spacing on the widgets.
5. To use setState() we must use a StatefulWidget.
